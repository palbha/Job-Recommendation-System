##Webscarping Codes

The attached codes are for webscraping the job related details from different website namely monster , shine and times-now .
We queried jobs related to data science and saved it as a csv file .
You can also use data from naukri (webscraping code already present in my repo)
The data was then stored into an excel file which contains data from all the three website.
The excel file was used to upload Mysql database and a jobs database with table name jobs was created .


Possible issues you may counter :
While uploading data to your Mysql database check the names of columns, they should be appropriate for proper working of the Dash web app .

FYI:
'title', 'company', 'min_exp(yrs)', 'max_exp(yrs)', 'salary','location', 'Posted on', 'keyskills', 'job_portal', 'url'
